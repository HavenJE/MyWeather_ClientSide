// The handleEdit() method being called in the onClick event is being passed down from the Locations container as a prop. handleEdit() accepts location as a parameter and and sets the state property, locationId to the locationâ€™s id. This property will be used inside the Locations component render method to determine which of the two forms will render, create or edit. If there is a locationId, the edit form will be rendered else the create form.
